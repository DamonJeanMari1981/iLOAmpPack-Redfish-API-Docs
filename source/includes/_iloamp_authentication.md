# Authentication and Sessions

```shell
$ curl https://{iLOAmpServer}/redfish/v1/systems/ -i --insecure -L
```
```python
# Perform GET operation against a resource at /redfish/v1/systems
import sys
import redfish

# Specify the remote iLO Amp address
login_host = "https://{iLOAmpServer}"

# Create a REDFISH object
REDFISH_OBJ = redfish.redfish_client(base_url=login_host)

# Do a GET on service root resource
response = REDFISH_OBJ.get("/redfish/v1/systems/")

# Print out the response
sys.stdout.write("%s\n" % response)
```

> The following shows the error displayed on `GET /redfish/v1/systems/` when no authentication is attempted:

```http

If you perform an HTTP operation (without providing authentication) on any resource other than the root `/redfish/v1/` resource, you will receive an `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` error indicating that you donâ€™t have the authentication needed to access the resource.

## Basic Authentication

```shell
curl https://{iLOAmpServer}/redfish/v1/systems/ --insecure -u username:password -L
```
```python
# Perform GET operation against a resource at /redfish/v1/systems/
import sys
import redfish

# When running remotely connect using the address, account name, 
# and password to send https requests
login_host = "https://{iLOAmpServer}"
login_account = "username"
login_password = "password"

## Create a REDFISH object
REDFISH_OBJ = redfish.redfish_client(base_url=login_host, \
                                     username=login_account, \
                                     password=login_password)

# Login into the server and create a session
REDFISH_OBJ.login(auth="basic")

# Do a GET on a given path
response = REDFISH_OBJ.get("/redfish/v1/systems/")

# Print out the response
sys.stdout.write("%s\n" % response.text)

# Logout of the current session
REDFISH_OBJ.logout()
```

> The above command (or program) returns the JSON response body as below:

```json
{
	"@odata.context" : "/redfish/v1/$metadata#ComputerSystemCollection.ComputerSystemCollection",
	"@odata.etag" : "W/\"09FA012B\"",
	"@odata.id" : "/redfish/v1/Systems",
	"@odata.type" : "#ComputerSystemCollection.ComputerSystemCollection",
	"Description" : "System Collection View",
	"Id" : "Systems",
	"Members" : [{
			"@odata.id" : "/redfish/v1/Systems/E1D8B426"
		}, {
			"@odata.id" : "/redfish/v1/Systems/E905C3FF"
		}, {
			"@odata.id" : "/redfish/v1/Systems/EF2BF486"
		}
	],
	"Members@odata.count" : 3,
	"Name" : "ComputerSystemCollection"
}
```

The RESTful API allows you to use HTTP Basic Authentication using a valid iLO Amplifier Pack user name and password.

## Creating and Using Sessions

```shell
curl https://{iLOAmpServer}/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/
  -X POST
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  --data "@data.json"
  --insecure 
  -i
```
<blockquote class="lang-specific shell">
  <p>Contents of data.json file</p>
  <p><code>
  {</br>
  "UserName": "username",</br>
  "Password": "password"</br>
  }</br>
  </code></p>
</blockquote>
```python
# Creating a session
import sys
import redfish

# When running remotely connect using the address, account name, 
# and password to send https requests
login_host = "https://{iLOAmpServer}"
login_account = "username"
login_password = "password"

## Create a REDFISH object
REDFISH_OBJ = redfish.redfish_client(base_url=login_host, \
                                     username=login_account, \
                                     password=login_password)

# Login into the server and create a session
REDFISH_OBJ.login(auth="session")
```

	}

```

For more complex multi-resource operations, you should log in and establish a session. To log in, iLO Amplifier Pack has a session manager object at the documented URI `/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/`. To create a session POST a JSON object to the Session manager:

<aside class="notice">
You must include the HTTP header <code>Content-Type: application/json</code> for all RESTful API operations that include a request body in JSON format.
</aside>

If the session is created successfully, you receive an `HTTP 201 Created` response from iLO Amplifier Pack. There will also be two important HTTP response headers.

* **X-Auth-Token:**	Your session token (string). This is a unique string for your login session. It must be included as a header in all subsequent HTTP operations in the session.

* **Location:**	The URI of the newly created session resource.	iLO Amplifier Pack allocates a new session resource describing your session. This is the URI that you must DELETE against, in order to log out. If you lose this location URI, you can find it by crawling the HREF links in the Sessions collection. Store this URI to facilitate logging out.

<aside class="warning">
It is good practice to save the Location URI of the newly created session.  This is your unique session information and is needed to log out later.
</aside>

The above process is implemented by the login method provided by REDFISH_OBJ of Redfish Python Library. It automatically stores the session key in REDFISH_OBJ. 

## Using a Session

To use a session, simply include the `X-Auth-Token` header supplied by the login response in all REST requests.

If REDFISH_OBJ of Redfish Python Library is used, then the login method automatically caches the session key and it is included in any future calls made using that object.

## Log Out of a Session

```shell
curl https://{iLOAmpServer}/redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/{item}/ 
  -X "DELETE" 
  -u username:password
  --insecure
```
```python
# Creating and deleting a session
import sys
import redfish

# When running remotely connect using the address, account name, 
# and password to send https requests
login_host = "https://{iLOAmpServer}"
login_account = "username"
login_password = "password"

## Create a REDFISH object
REDFISH_OBJ = redfish.redfish_client(base_url=login_host, \
                                     username=login_account, \
                                     password=login_password)

# Login into the server and create a session
REDFISH_OBJ.login(auth="session")

# Logout of the current session
REDFISH_OBJ.logout()
```

iLO Amplifier Pack supports a limited number of simultaneous sessions.  If you do not log out of a session it will expire automatically after a time of inactivity.  However, it is good practice to log out when finished with a session.

To log out perform an `HTTP DELETE` to the URI that was returned in the "Location" header when you created the session.

<aside class="notice">
If you cannot preserve the session URI on login, you may iterate the Sessions collection at /redfish/v1/SessionService/Sessions/.  Be sure to include the X-Auth-Token header.  For each session, look for a JSON property called "MySession" that is true. You may then DELETE that URI.
</aside>

If REDFISH_OBJ of Redfish Python Library is used, then the logout method delete's the session using the location URI that was previously cached.
